# Learning WebAssembly
My path to learning WebAssembly.

Dear competitive programmers, low-level developers, system
designers, back-end developers, bug busters, C, C++,
Rust, Golang, and Python developers,

Have you ever wondered how awesome it would be to run the
code that YOU write in web browsers? It is made even more
awesome by WASM (WebAssembly), which lets you compile your
code directly to WASM as a target and get it to run in any
front-end web application, on all browsers. 😊
